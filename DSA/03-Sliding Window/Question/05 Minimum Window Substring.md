# [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

**Difficulty:** HARD

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window*** ***substring*** *of* `s` *such that every character in* `t` *(**including duplicates**) is included in the window*. If there is no such substring, return *the empty string* `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == s.length`
* `n == t.length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 105`
* `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

### Terminology
- **Substring**: A contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
