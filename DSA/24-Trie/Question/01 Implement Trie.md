# [Implement Trie](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)

**Difficulty:** MEDIUM

A [**trie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (pronounced as "try") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

* `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
* `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
* `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
* `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
Output
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

Explanation
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
trie.search("apple");   // return True
trie.search("app");     // return False
trie.startsWith("app"); // return True
trie.insert("app");
trie.search("app");     // return True
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000`
* `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters.
* At most `3 * 104` calls **in total** will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.

### Terminology
- **Trie**: A type of search tree, a tree data structure used for locating specific keys from within a set. These keys are most often strings, with links between nodes defined not by the entire key, but by individual characters.
